Task 1: Arrow Functions

1. Create an array of numbers and use the `map` function with an arrow function to square each
element in the array.
2. Write a function that takes an array of strings and uses the `filter` function with an arrow
function to return only strings with more than 5 characters.

Task 2: Destructuring

3. Given the object `person` with properties `name` and `age`, use destructuring to extract these
properties into individual variables.
4. Create a function that takes an object as a parameter and uses destructuring to extract and
log specific properties.

Task 3: Template Literals

5. Write a function that takes a person's name and age and uses template literals to create a
sentence that introduces the person.
6. Create an array of objects with information about books (title, author, year). Write a function
that uses template literals to log information about each book in the array.

Task 4: Spread and Rest Operators

7. Use the spread operator to concatenate two arrays into a new array.
8. Write a function that takes multiple arguments and uses the rest operator to collect them into
an array.

Task 5: Classes and Inheritance

9. Create a class `Animal` with properties `name` and `sound`. Extend this class to create a
subclass `Bird` with an additional property `canFly`.
10. Write a function that takes an array of objects representing shapes (circle, square) and uses
classes and inheritance to calculate and log the area of each shape.

Task 6: Promises

11. Create a promise that resolves after a delay of 3 seconds and logs a success message.
12. Write a function that uses promises to fetch data from an API and log the result.

Task 7: Async/Await

13. Refactor the promise example from task 11 to use async/await.
14. Create an async function that fetches data from two different APIs and returns the combined
result.

Task 8: Modules

15. Create a module that exports a function to calculate the area of a rectangle.
16. Import and use the module function in another file to calculate the area of a rectangle.
